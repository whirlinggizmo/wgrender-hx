// wgrender's fetch example, as a Haxe guest: the desktop build downloads what the
// browser downloads.
//
// A port of examples/fetch.c. On the web the browser fetches a missing asset and
// caches it. On desktop wgrender ships no HTTP client and no TLS, so it asks the
// program for one: set a URL as the asset host, hand it a fetcher, and a cache miss
// becomes a download.
//
//     Asset.setCacheDir("build/asset-cache");
//     Asset.setHost("https://.../examples/assets");
//     Asset.setFetcher((request, url, destPath) -> ...);
//
// The C example writes a fetcher that shells out to curl, because C has no HTTP in the
// box and the point is to link nothing. Haxe has one, so there is nothing here to
// write: this example's build passes `-D WGR_INCLUDE_FETCHER`, and the binding
// installs `haxe.Http` over hxcpp's bundled mbedtls the first time a URL host is set.
// The program only says where the assets live.
//
// It is a define rather than the default because it costs about a megabyte and almost
// no desktop program needs it: wgrender consults a fetcher only when the host is a URL
// or a task was handed a fetchUrl, and a shipped game's host is the `assets` directory
// beside the executable. Measured: installing it unconditionally grew a guest that
// never downloads anything from 2,807,448 to 4,588,784 bytes. Without the define
// nothing is referenced, so `-dce full` leaves the whole TLS stack out.
//
// Set a URL host in a build without the define and the binding says so once, because
// wgrender's miss path would otherwise just fail the asset without mentioning the one
// thing that was missing.
//
// Bytes never cross the boundary. wgrender names a URL and a destination file and the
// fetcher writes that file, which is what curl, WinHTTP and NSURLSession all hand you
// anyway. Downloads land in the cache directory and the next run finds them there,
// which is the job the browser's cache does on the web.
//
// The guards here are Haxe's, not wgrender's, and that distinction is the point.
// `Asset.setFetcher` compiles on both targets and answers false on the web, where
// there is nothing to install -- the browser is the downloader. What needs `#if sys`
// is reading an environment variable and writing a file, which are facts about the
// standard library rather than about the binding.
