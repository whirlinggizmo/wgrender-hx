// wgrender's force_fetch example, as a Haxe guest: both of `ensure`'s overrides at
// once, a per-call source URL and a cache bypass.
//
// A port of examples/force_fetch.c. The asset *key* is a path with nothing behind it,
// so a plain load would only fail; the bytes come from an explicit `fetchUrl`, and
// `ForceFetch` makes it go to the network rather than to whatever is cached. That the
// music plays is the proof the override was honoured, and it is cached under the
// bogus key afterwards.
//
// The URL is the asset base's (wgr.Assets), not the server root's: "/assets/..." would
// be wrong anywhere the site is not at one -- GitHub Pages serves a project under
// /<repo>/, and the examples' site keeps the assets beside the pages, not under them.
// An absolute https://cdn.example/... URL passes through the same way.
//
// This is the example that widened the guest ABI. `wgr_guest_asset_load` took a path
// and an id, which is everything the earlier examples need and nothing this one does,
// so it now takes wgrender's `fetch_url` and `flags` as well.
//
//   M    toggle the music
//   ESC  quit
