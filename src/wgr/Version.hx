/**
	A binding is generated from a particular wgrender's headers, and then runs against
	whatever library it is given. Those are not the same thing, and on the web they are
	not even the same download: `wgrender-host.wasm` and the guest's JS are fetched and
	cached independently, so a browser can pair a stale guest with a fresh host.

	`check` reports whether that pairing is one to trust. Major or minor apart means
	the C API may have moved under the binding; a patch apart is allowed through.
