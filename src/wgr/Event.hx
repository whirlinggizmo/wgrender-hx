// wgr_event.h — a named event bus

/**
	A bus of named events. wgrender never emits on it itself: it is there so the
	parts of a program — and any C-side component alongside them — can tell each
	other things without knowing about each other.

	`emit` can carry a payload, because the bus does: a C-side component may be
	listening and may know what is behind the pointer. A Haxe listener is not handed
	it. That is partly because a `void *` is nothing a Haxe program can safely read,
	and partly because a Haxe closure taking a raw pointer does not compile on hxcpp
	4.3.2 -- the generated `__Run(Array<Dynamic>)` needs a `Dynamic` to `void *`
	conversion that it finds ambiguous. Reach for `wgr.impl.Raw` if you genuinely need
	the pointer; that is what it is for.

	Listening needs a C function pointer, which a Haxe closure is not — so both targets
	register one dispatcher with wgrender and carry a table key in the `user_data`
	(`wgr.impl.Trampoline`). On js that costs a single entry in the wasm function
	table for the whole program, however many listeners there are.
