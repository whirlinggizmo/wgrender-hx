		unwinds out of `main` and exits 255. So every callback wgrender makes into
		Haxe catches at the edge and logs instead, and a bad frame stays a bad frame.

		`e.message`, not `e.details()`: hxcpp has no stack to add unless the build
		defines `HXCPP_STACK_TRACE`, so `details()` says the same thing for 57 KB more
		wasm. Define it if you want stacks and can spend that.

		host already does, so routing hxcpp the same way makes one source build either
		shape: all-in-one, where the Haxe program is linked with wgrender, or as a
		guest of a wasm host.

		Setting the raw `wgr_set_frame` from a guest would replace the glue's own
		handler and stop the ABI being called at all, which is why `Raw` does not offer
		it on js. Going through the glue is the version that cannot do that.
