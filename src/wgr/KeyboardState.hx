	Every key at once, plus the keys and characters that arrived this frame.

	For one key, `Input.getKey` / `Input.isKeyPressed` are simpler; this is for code
	that wants the whole keyboard, or the text a frame produced.

	On js this is a view into the wasm heap, not a copy — 2324 bytes is too much to
	marshal per frame — so it is only good for the frame it was read in. Read what
	you need and let it go; don't keep one in a field.
