// wgr_environment.h — the environment map resource

/**
	An environment map: lights a scene's PBR models with the world around them, and
	can stand behind them as a skybox. Reference counted and shared, like any resource.

	Load an equirectangular (2:1) image — a Radiance `.hdr` for true high dynamic
	range, or a PNG/JPEG for low. Creating one prepares its lighting on the CPU,
	which takes a fraction of a second for a 1K image, so create environments while
	loading rather than mid-frame.

	Use with `Scene.setEnvironment`, `Scene.setBackground` and `Scene.setTonemap`.
