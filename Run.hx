/**
	`haxelib run wgrender-hx <command>`.

	An installed wgrender-hx carries wgrender as a submodule under project/lib, and
	`haxelib git` fetches it along with everything else, so for a native target there
	is nothing for this to do: hxcpp compiles wgrender's sources with the same
	toolchain it compiles your program with, which is what lets Windows work at all.
	Verified by installing into an empty haxelib repository and building an example
	without running setup at all.

	The web target is different. There wgrender is a wasm *host* the page loads and
	the game is a JS guest on top of it, so the host is an emcc link of wgrender's web
	library, which its tools/buildweb.py builds with emcc and Python alone.

	    haxelib run wgrender-hx setup          fetch or update the wgrender submodule
	    haxelib run wgrender-hx setup web      also build the Emscripten host library
	    haxelib run wgrender-hx where          print what is present

	Normally none of this is needed. `haxelib git` clones submodules, so wgrender is
	already there, and a native build compiles its sources rather than linking a
	library. `setup` is for the cases where that did not happen: a submodule that did
	not come down, or an archive install once this is published, since a haxelib zip
	is flat and carries no submodule.

	Nothing here is needed in a checkout of this repo: the examples and test/check.py
	define WGR_BUILD_XML and point at whatever wgrender they are working against.
