/* The guest ABI: wgrender as a host, a guest module as the game.
 *
 * libwgrender owns the window, the loop, assets, input and the scene; the guest owns
 * game state and logic. This is wg-vf's host/guest split applied to a renderer — see
 * wg-vf's docs/vignette-author-guide.md, whose operation table this mirrors.
 *
 * The guest registers four ops and the host calls them. Guarantees the host makes,
 * the same ones wg-vf promises:
 *
 *   1. Serial, non-reentrant, single-threaded. Ops are never called concurrently or
 *      nested. The guest MAY call wgrender's API during an op — that is the point —
 *      but the host will not re-enter the guest while one is running.
 *   2. `init` first, `shutdown` last. Nothing before init returns, nothing after
 *      shutdown begins.
 *   3. `asset` fires on the main thread during a later frame, never inside another op.
 *
 * Ops return 0 for ok and nonzero for a fault. A guest in a language with exceptions
 * catches at its own edge and converts a throw into a nonzero return: an exception
 * that escapes into these C frames takes the loop down (measured: on the web the page
 * freezes with an opaque `Uncaught [object WebAssembly.Exception]`).
 *
 * What the host does with a fault is policy — see wgr_guest_fault_policy_t.
