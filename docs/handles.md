# Handles: what the type system buys, and what C already does

Written 2026-09-22, because the question "should handles just be `Int`?" kept getting
re-derived from scratch. It applies whatever shape the API layer ends up in, which is
why it lives here rather than beside the flattening trial on the `flat-api` branch.
Everything below was measured, not reasoned about; the commands are given so it can be
re-checked when something changes.

## What a handle is

`wgr_handle_t` is 32 bits, laid out in `src/internal/wgr_handle_pool_internal.h`:

```
  bit 31                        26 25              16 15                    0
  +-------------------------------+------------------+----------------------+
  |          kind (6)             |  generation (10) |      index (16)      |
  +-------------------------------+------------------+----------------------+
```

librl uses the identical scheme — wgrender's `wgr_handle_kind_t` is visibly descended
from `rl_handle_kind_t`, same numbers, with `COLOR = 1` and `MUSIC = 10` retired.

**C checks the kind on every call.** `wgri_handle_pool_resolve` tests it *first*,
before index, occupancy and generation:

```c
if (WGRI_HANDLE_KIND(handle) != (uint8_t)pool->kind) return false;
if (index == 0 || index >= pool->capacity)          return false;
if (!pool->occupied[index])                          return false;
if (pool->generations[index] != generation)          return false;
```

A subsystem's `resolve()` then logs and returns NULL, and the setter returns `false`:

```c
if (handle != 0) log_warn("Invalid model handle (%u)", (unsigned int)handle);
```

Note `handle != 0`: a none handle is silent, deliberately, because `0` is a value you
pass on purpose — you can create a model with mesh `0` and set the real mesh when it
loads. That is librl's convention and wgrender keeps it.

So **the runtime kind check is unconditional and already paid for.** No binding needs
to add one. Passing a `Model` where a `Material` is wanted is caught whatever the
binding's types look like; it comes back as a logged `false` rather than a crash.

## What the type system adds on top

It moves the statically-knowable subset of that check from runtime to compile time. It
does not replace it — see "what types cannot catch" below.

Measured in Haxe 4.3.6 against `src/wgr`, and in Nim 2.2.12 against a `distinct`
sketch of the same design:

| | Haxe typed abstract | Nim `distinct` | one untyped handle | raw `Int` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Model` passed as `Material` | rejected | rejected | accepted | accepted |
| bare literal `0` as an argument | rejected | rejected | accepted | accepted |
| `Handle.NONE` as an argument | accepted | accepted (`converter`) | accepted | accepted |
| `m == otherMaterial` | works | needs `{.borrow.}` per level | works | works |
| `m == 0` | **compiles** | rejected | compiles | compiles |
| unassigned field, on js | `undefined` | n/a — zero-initialised | `undefined` | `undefined` |

Two rows deserve their own note.

**`Handle.NONE` passes but a bare `0` does not.** `Material` is declared `from Handle`,
not `from Int`, so `Model.create(Handle.NONE)` compiles and `Model.create(0)` does not.
That is the "0 is deliberate" rule made enforceable instead of documented, and it is the
main thing a single untyped handle gives up. Reproduce:

```
haxe -cp src --main Mix --js /tmp/mix.js   # Material.setRoughness(model, 0.5) -> error
```

**`m == 0` compiles in Haxe and is wrong on js.** The `0` is promoted at the typed
abstract (`Int` -> `Handle` -> `Material`), so an `@:op(A == B)` on `Handle` never sees
the comparison — there is nothing to overload. And an unassigned field on js is
`undefined`, where `undefined == 0` is `false`, so the comparison reports a live handle
for something that holds nothing.

This is **not** caused by the abstracts. Raw `Int` behaves identically:

```haxe
static var asInt:Int;        // never assigned
asInt == 0      // false — the value is `undefined`
asInt == null   // true
```

So dropping the abstracts does not fix it, and all four columns need the same free
`isNone` / `isValid` inline. `wgr.Handle.isNone` carries the `== null` tolerance for
this reason, and any flat replacement has to keep it -- flattening loses the
discoverability of `m.isNone` after a dot, not the correctness, provided the free form
tolerates `null` the same way.

## What types cannot catch

A **stale** handle — released, its slot reused — has the right kind *and* the right
index. Only the 10-bit generation counter distinguishes it, and no type system sees
that. `wgri_handle_pool_resolve` does.

So the C check and the type check catch different classes of bug and neither subsumes
the other:

| | wrong kind | dead handle | wrong kind, caught early |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C pool resolve | yes | **yes** | no — at the call |
| typed handles | yes | no | **yes** — at compile time |

## Do not add a kind check in the binding

The obvious idea — have the flat API verify the kind before calling — is duplicate work,
and both ways of doing it are worse than not doing it:

- **`wgr_handle_get_kind(h)`** is a real C call per setter. On js that is a marshalling
  round trip, and the frame cost measured at the noise floor
  (0.343 ms against 0.348 ms of script time per frame, measured on the `flat-api`
  branch) would stop being at the noise floor.
- **`(h >>> 26) & 63` inline in Haxe** is genuinely cheap — a couple of instructions —
  but the layout lives in `src/internal/wgr_handle_pool_internal.h`. That is an internal
  header. A binding that reads it breaks silently the day the layout changes, and so
  would every other binding that copied the trick.

C is already doing this, first thing, on every call. Let it.

## Where this leaves the design

Keep the typed abstracts. They cost nothing — zero occurrences in the generated js,
they compile fully away — and they buy two compile-time guards, one of which protects
the `0`-is-deliberate convention. The thing that actually broke cross-binding parity was
**properties**, not typed handles: `tools/audit_binding_parity.py` in librl mirrors C
*names*, and typed handles change no name. Flattening the API buys the parity; dropping
the types buys nothing.

## What the conversion cost, measured

`examples/materials`, the same scene, before and after the whole API flattened:

| | raw | gzipped | script ms/frame |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| properties and methods | 20,788 | 4,660 | 0.348 |
| flat statics | 20,846 | 4,665 | 0.339 |

A wash on size (+58 bytes raw, +5 gzipped) and inside the noise on frame cost, which
is the result `inline` predicts: the members compile away either way, so the generated
code is the same calls in the same order.

This corrects the trial, which measured flat as *smaller* (19,975 raw). That number
came from a hand-written slice covering only what one example needed, against the full
sharp API; it was not a like-for-like comparison and the whole conversion does not
reproduce it. Flattening is worth doing for the mapping, the returned `Bool`s and
cross-binding parity — not for bytes.

## What flattening did to the tooling

`tools/setters.py` is gone. It asked "should this member be a property or a method?",
which only has subjects while there are properties; the flat API has one, and it has
no C call behind it. Most of its 388 lines existed to infer *which* C call a member
wrapped, because `wgr_model_set_tint -> Model.tint` cannot be read off a name. Making
the name the mapping deleted the inference, and with it the `DELEGATED` table of
hand-written verdicts and the regex reader of C control flow that needed it.

What survived moved into `tools/refusals.py --check`: a refusal a header names must be
repeated in the binding's doc comment. That half was always the trustworthy one -- prose
against prose, safe to fail a build on, as against the C reading that only warned and had
produced one false clean and two false positives. The member index it needs is now one
regex over the flat sources, because every member is a static whose body is its `Raw`
call; the tool it replaced needed 37 lines and an exception table for the same job, and
still lost members silently when one grew a second line.

One exception list remains, `UNREACHABLE`: refusals the binding's types rule out, where
an `enum abstract` with two values cannot produce the third that wgrender would reject.
Documenting those would be noise rather than accuracy.

**What does not become derivable.** `Material.setRoughness` calls
`setFloat(material, "roughness", value)` -> `wgr_material_set_float`. The nine built-in
parameters are many-to-one on `wgr_material_set_float`/`_texture` *in the C*, so no
naming scheme fixes it -- a fixed list written once, not something parsed out of source.

**What belongs in wgrender-c either way.** Eight refusals that log nothing anywhere, and
`wgr_light_set_shadow_map_size` clamping to 256..4096 with no getter to observe the
result. Those are findings about the C library, whatever shape the binding is.

## If wgrender ever gets a Nim binding

`distinct` maps onto the typed abstracts one-for-one, and is strictly stronger on the
two things that bit us:

- `m == 0` is **rejected**, and stays rejected after `{.borrow.}`ing `==`, so the
  `isNone` discipline is enforced rather than documented;
- Nim zero-initialises, so the `undefined == 0` hazard does not exist.

Two Nim-specific costs:

- `NONE`-passes-anywhere needs a `converter` per type, and implicit converters are
  discouraged in Nim style. The alternatives — explicit `Material(0)`, or a generic
  `none[Material]()` — lose the convenience that makes the convention worth having.
- `{.borrow.}` is needed at *each* distinct level. With
  `Material = distinct Handle`, borrowing `==` on `Material` alone fails; `Handle` needs
  it too. Easy to get wrong once, then it is boilerplate.

And Nim's UFCS means the flat statics read as methods for free — `setRoughness(m, 0.5)`
and `m.setRoughness(0.5)` are the same call — so flattening costs nothing in
readability there.

For contrast, librl's Nim binding today is `RLHandle* = uint32`, a plain alias: colors
and models share one type and nothing is caught until C sees it. librl's Haxe binding
is `abstract RLHandle(Int) from Int to Int` — one untyped abstract, the third column
above. So `distinct` would be an upgrade on what librl does, not a port of it.
