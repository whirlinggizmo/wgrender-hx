"""Run the binding against headless wgrender and assert what it gets back.

    test/check.py [WGRENDER_DIR]
    test/check.py --lists      only the WebHost list guards: pure Python, for CI

Headless is wgrender's own test build (-D wgr-headless: its headless flags, compiled in
by project/Build.xml as any build of the binding is): no window, GPU or audio, and
WGR_HEADLESS_FRAMES runs a fixed number of frames and returns, so the checks can assert
values rather than only compile. The work is in build/<os>/headless/.

This is the library's own test suite, not an example's. It lived in examples/simple-
hxcpp while the binding and that port grew together, which meant the thing that
decides whether wgrender-hx works was inside one of the things it was testing.

It runs three generators in --check mode first, because each guards a different way
the binding can be wrong without failing to compile:

  gen_raw    the C surface is generated from wgrender's headers; a stale one declares
             an API that no longer exists
  coverage   a stale omissions list hides a decision as a to-do
  refusals   wgrender's headers name every value a call refuses, and this fails if
             one of those sentences is not repeated in the binding's own docs
  keys       src/wgr/Key.hx is generated from wgr_keys.h, and this fails when a key
             moves; its static_asserts then fail the C++ build too
  sources    project/wgrender.xml lists wgrender's C files and flags for every build
             to compile with, and this fails when wgrender's build.json moves

Then it builds the suite twice: native, where it runs, and against the js binding,
where there is no host loop but a wrapper that exists only on hxcpp fails here rather
than in whichever example first happened to call it.
