"""Every way a wgrender call can return false, read from the C with clang.

    tools/refusals.py [WGRENDER_DIR]        the report
    tools/refusals.py --check [WGRENDER_DIR] the gate: a refusal a header names and
                                             the binding's docs do not
    tools/refusals.py --json [WGRENDER_DIR] the report, as JSON on stdout
    tools/refusals.py --require-clang       fail rather than skip when clang is missing

Two halves, both about refusals. The report reads the C. The check reads prose
against prose: AGENTS.md makes a header's "false for ..." a contract, so a binding
that does not repeat the sentence is dropping what it was told.

This replaces tools/setters.py, which asked a question that no longer has subjects.
Its rule was "a property is right when every way the call can fail is one wgrender
logs, and a method returning Bool is right when it can fail silently" -- which only
matters while there are properties. There is one left, and it has no C call behind
it. What made that tool 388 lines was inferring which C call a member wrapped, since
`wgr_model_set_tint -> Model.tint` cannot be read off a name; flattening made the
name the mapping, and the inference, the DELEGATED table of hand-written verdicts
and the regex reader of C control flow all went with it.

This replaces the regular expressions that tools/setters.py used to read wgrender's
control flow with. Those could not be trusted -- they produced one false clean (a
guard written with braces), two false positives (an allocation check read as a
refusal), and could not read wgr_window.c at all, which is why setters.py grew a
DELEGATED table of hand-written verdicts. An AST has none of those failure modes:
a condition is a condition whatever it is spelled like.

clang comes from emsdk, which the web build already needs -- `emcc` on PATH leads to
it. There is no regex fallback on purpose: a second implementation that disagrees
with the first is worse than no answer, and the regex was the flaky one. Without
clang this exits 0 and says it is skipping, and CI (which builds the web target, so
always has emsdk) is what makes sure the step actually runs before main moves.

A file that fails to parse is a hard error, never a skip. Under `2>/dev/null` an
earlier version of this reported a clean audit over 44 of 46 sources, because
compile_flags.txt was missing -Ideps/sokol_utils. Silently reading less of the
library than you think is the exact failure this tool exists to end.
