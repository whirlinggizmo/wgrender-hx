In order:

  1. a path given on the command line, or $WGRENDER_DIR
  2. ../wgrender-c beside this repo -- a checkout, working against its own wgrender
  3. project/lib/wgrender-c -- the vendored submodule, which is what an install has

Eight tools used to guess at this, with seven different answers: most assumed the
sibling checkout, gen_sources assumed the submodule, and coverage.py ignored
WGRENDER_DIR altogether. Building an example out of a `haxelib git` install found it,
because there the sibling does not exist and every tool but one looked there anyway.
