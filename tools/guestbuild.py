"""The suite's work for one example: its own hxml files, and the chores around them.

Each example is what a user would write: its src/, a build.web.hxml, and a
build.desktop.hxml. Those are the build -- `haxe build.web.hxml` from the example's
directory produces the same out/web this script does, host and all, because the wasm
host is linked by wgr.macros.WebHost from a line in that file. So this is not a build
system, and there is no script in each example to run it: examples/build.py imports it
and names the example. It is the things a copy of an example does not need and the
suite does:

- it refuses to build against the wrong copy of the binding (check_library), or a
  binding that is stale against wgrender's headers (check_binding);
- it passes -D WGRENDER_DIR, so the examples build against the wgrender this checkout
  is paired with -- a wgrender-c beside it, when there is one -- rather than only the
  pinned submodule. A user's build leaves it out and gets the submodule on both targets;
- after a desktop build it copies the binary out of hxcpp's scratch and puts an
  `assets` link beside it, where wgr.Assets looks. A user's own game ships its own
  assets and does not need that step;
- sizes and clean. Serving is examples/build.py's: one server, every example in a
  subdirectory of it.

`guest` and `host` still work and mean `web`: the guest and its host are one build now.
