"""What the Haxe guest ports cost against wgrender's own C builds of the same example.

    tools/compare.py [DIR ...]      default: the sibling example directories

Like against like: both sides are the same wgrender, the same backend and the same
threading (WEB_THREADS=0), so the only difference is the language the game is written
in. Build the C side first:

    make -C wgrender-c wasm-all WEB_THREADS=0

What a visitor downloads is what is measured -- wasm plus JS, and the gzipped total,
since that is what crosses the wire. The Haxe side has a third file: the host wasm is
wgrender, the host JS is Emscripten's glue, and the guest JS is the game.

The host shrinks per example. It exports exactly the wgrender calls the compiled guest
makes, so an example that never touches audio or particles does not carry them.
