# wgrender-hx

Haxe bindings for [wgrender](https://github.com/whirlinggizmo/wgrender-c), over two
targets from one API:

- **hxcpp** — native desktop, or compiled into the wasm alongside wgrender
- **js** — wgrender is a wasm *host* and your game is a guest module, so the Haxe
  runtime never enters the binary

```haxe
import wgr.*;

final mesh = Mesh.create(path);
model = Model.create(mesh);            // wgrender's rule: object from resource, resource from path
Mesh.release(mesh);                    // the model holds its own reference
Model.setAnimationLoop(model, true);
Model.setTint(model, Color.RAYWHITE);
Scene.add(scene, model);               // takes a Model, Sprite3D, Text2D, Text3D or Light

if (pick.handle == model) ...          // the untyped pick handle still compares to typed ones
```

## Layout

```
src/wgr/*.hx          the API — one module per wgrender public header
src/wgr/GuestAbi.hx   installing the guest's ops; .{cpp,js}.hx per target
src/wgr/import.hx     gives those modules the C surface (not in macro context)
src/wgr/macros/       compile-time code, run from an hxml: WebHost links a guest's host
src/wgr/impl/         the generated C surface, chosen by target. Nothing outside the
                      binding imports from here; an app needs `import wgr.*` and no more
  Raw.hx                #error for a target with no implementation
  Raw.cpp.hx            hxcpp externs against wgr.h
  Raw.js.hx             calls the host module's exports, and marshals
  GuestRaw.cpp.hx       externs for host/wgr_guest.h, which is this binding's own C
host/wgr_guest.{c,h}  the guest ABI: wgrender as a host, five ops
test/                 the binding's own suite: 317 assertions against headless wgrender
examples/             thirty-two guests, and simple-hxcpp the other way (all-in-one)
project/              how an installed copy links wgrender, and the submodule it uses
Run.hx                `haxelib run wgrender-hx setup`

tools/gen_raw.py      writes BOTH impl/Raw.*.hx whole, from wgrender's include/*.h
tools/gen_keys.py     regenerates wgr.Key from wgrender's wgr_keys.h
tools/coverage.py     what the binding reaches, and what wrapping next buys
tools/refusals.py     every way a wgrender call can return false, read from the C
                      with clang; --check fails if a documented refusal is not
                      repeated in these docs
tools/guestbuild.py   the examples' suite runner: checks, desktop assets, sizes, serve
tools/compare.py      each example's size against wgrender's own C build of it
tools/benchmarks.py   size, frame cost, GC and call cost against the C -> docs/benchmarks.md
tools/drive.mjs       run a built example and fail on anything the console calls an error
```

Every operation is a static named after the C call it makes, taking the handle first:
`wgr_model_set_tint` is `Model.setTint`, `wgr_model_is_visible` is `Model.isVisible`,
`wgr_window_has_fullscreen` is `Window.hasFullscreen`. The name is the mapping, which
is what lets the binding be audited mechanically (`tools/refusals.py --check`) and what
keeps a second binding in step — a property has no counterpart in Lua or Nim, and it
cannot return the `Bool` a wgrender setter uses to refuse.

A member that only reads struct data keeps its shape, because there is no C name to
mirror: `Vec3.x`, `MouseState`, `KeyboardState.isPressed`, `Handle.isNone`.

Anything with a transform has the same calls for it, as in C: `setTransform` with every
part it has (none of them optional), and `setPosition`, `setRotation`, `setScale` and
their getters for one part at a time, which leave the others as they are. So moving a
model is `Model.setPosition(model, p)`, with no need to know or keep its rotation and
scale; `setTransform` is the one call a frame for something whose parts all change.
Pass `Vec3.ZERO` or `Vec3.ONE` for a part that isn't turned or scaled. Nothing here
allocates: a `new Vec3(...)` handed to an inline call compiles away.

Every handle kind is an `abstract` over `Int` and every member is `inline`, so the API
layer compiles away: a call costs what the C call costs. The only allocations are the
small value objects (`Vec2`, `Vec3`, `MouseState`, `PickResult`) the wrappers return.
The typed abstracts are free too, and they earn their place twice: a `Mesh` where a
`Texture` belongs is a compile error, and so is a bare literal `0` where `Handle.NONE`
is accepted — which makes "0 is a value you pass on purpose" enforceable rather than
documented. See `docs/handles.md`.

### Why handles aren't `null`

A handle is 0 when it refers to nothing, and `isNone` reports that — rather than the
`model != null` a Haxe developer would reach for first — `Model.isNone(model)`, or
`Handle.isNone` on an untyped one.

0 is a value you *pass*, not only one you get back. `Model.create(Handle.NONE)` is an
empty model that joins the scene immediately and is given its mesh when the asset
arrives, so the frame loop never asks whether it has loaded — which is how `model`,
`materials`, `lights`, `sprite2d` and `text3d` are all written, following the C.
So `isNone` means "empty", not "invalid", and that is why it is not called `isValid`.

Using 0 rather than `null` is deliberate, and measured:

- **`null` is not 0.** On hxcpp `Null<Int>(0) == null` is `false`, so the two would
  have to be mapped at every boundary, in both directions.
- **`Null<Model>` stops being an `Int`.** hxcpp renders it as `::Dynamic` — boxed, and
  no longer inlinable, which is the whole point of the layer.
- It would only be free on js, where `null` is native.

A field needs no initialiser either way: `isNone` treats js's `undefined` as none, so
`static var model:Model;` is correct on both targets. Without that it would be correct
on hxcpp (an uninitialised `Int` static is 0) and quietly wrong on js (`undefined == 0`
is `false`).

**`isNone` is the only test that is right on both targets.** `h == 0` and
`h == Handle.NONE` compile, and are right on hxcpp and right on js for a field that was
assigned — but both say `false` for an uninitialised field on js, for the same
`undefined == 0` reason. Measured, not reasoned:

| on js | uninitialised | assigned `Handle.NONE` |
|---|---|---|
| `h == 0` | `false` | `true` |
| `h == Handle.NONE` | `false` | `true` |
| `h.isNone` | `true` | `true` |

The 0 is promoted at the typed abstract (`Int` → `Handle` → `Model`), so an operator
overload on `Handle` never sees the comparison and cannot correct it.

Note what this does *not* argue. The abstract does not prevent `== 0` — the table above
is measured with it in place. It only makes `isNone` discoverable, because `h.` offers
it. A flattened API would carry the same check as a free function,
`Handle.isNone(h)`, with the same `undefined` tolerance inside it; what it would lose
is the autocomplete, not the correctness.

## The two shapes

An **all-in-one** app calls `Wgr.initValues` / `setInit` / `setFrame` / `run` and is
compiled into the binary (or the wasm) with wgrender. A **guest** app implements
`host/wgr_guest.h`'s ops — `init`, `frame`, `asset`, `shutdown`, and an optional
fixed-rate `tick` — and the host
calls them; on js the host is a wasm module the page loads, on hxcpp it is linked in
and the Haxe program's `main` is the entry point.

The `@:buildXml` carrying the link configuration rides on `wgr.impl.Raw`, because
every program that touches wgrender at all reaches that class — anything in the API
layer can be stripped by `-dce full` out from under the build.

A handful of the API modules carry a target guard; the rest compile for both
untouched.

## Logging

`Log.info(msg)` reaches wgrender's logger through `wgr_logger_message_source`, with
the file and line filled in by the compiler from `haxe.PosInfos` — so a line reads
`[INFO ] Guest.hx:91: ...`, naming the Haxe call site rather than generated C++.
`Log.plain(level, msg)` is the bare form.

The message is handed over as a `%s` argument, never as the format string itself, so
text can't be read as a format directive and nothing has to be escaped. On js, a log
before the host module is attached falls back to `console.log` rather than throwing —
startup going wrong is exactly when you want the log.

## Assets

`Assets.defaultBase()` resolves where assets load from at run time, rather than from a
compile-time define, so a built program is relocatable and a development build uses
the same lookup a shipped one does:

| | |
|---|---|
| web (js or hxcpp/Emscripten) | `/assets` — what `tools/serve.py` mounts, and what a host should serve |
| native | `$WGR_ASSET_BASE`, then an `assets` directory beside the executable, then `assets` relative to the working directory |

wgrender links no HTTP and no TLS, so a miss on a native build is a question it asks
the program: `Asset.setFetcher`. The binding ships the answer —
`Asset.setFetcher(Asset.httpFetcher)` installs `haxe.Http` over hxcpp's bundled
mbedtls, verifying certificates from the system store. It costs about a megabyte of
binary and only if you name it: a program that never installs a fetcher is byte for
byte the size it was, measured. On the web there is nothing to install and
`setFetcher` answers `false`, because the browser is already the downloader.

An app's build is expected to put `assets` next to the built executable — the examples
link it to wherever wgrender is checked out.

## Using it

```sh
haxelib git wgrender-hx https://github.com/whirlinggizmo/wgrender-hx
```

then `-lib wgrender-hx`. That is the whole install: `haxelib git` clones submodules
too, so wgrender arrives under `project/lib` with its sources and vendored
dependencies, and `project/Build.xml` hands hxcpp the include paths and the C files to
compile. There is no library to build first and nothing to point at by hand, because
hxcpp compiles wgrender with the same toolchain it compiles your program with.

**On Windows, add `-D HXCPP_M64`.** hxcpp builds 32-bit there unless told otherwise,
which is rarely what a game wants. The examples' `build.desktop.hxml` files carry the flag; it does nothing on Linux or macOS,
which build 64-bit anyway.

`haxelib run wgrender-hx setup` exists for when that is not true — a submodule that
did not come down, or an archive install once this is published, since a haxelib zip
is flat and carries no submodule.

**Run it after every `haxelib update wgrender-hx`.** That updates this library and
leaves the submodule where it was, so wgrender stays at whatever commit it was first
cloned at; the binding is generated from wgrender's headers, so it then reports itself
STALE against the older ones and refuses to build. `setup` moves the submodule to the
commit this library pins. It fetches what is missing and reports; for a
native target it has nothing to build. `setup web` additionally builds wgrender's
Emscripten library, which `wgr.macros.WebHost` and the examples' own build both do
for you.

`haxelib run wgrender-hx where` says what is present.

Working on the binding itself instead:

```sh
haxelib dev wgrender-hx /path/to/wgrender-hx
```

and pass `-D WGRENDER_DIR=<path>` to build against a wgrender of your own rather than
the vendored one. That is the only difference between a checkout's build and an
install's: both go through `project/Build.xml`, which compiles wgrender with the same
toolchain as your program, so a checkout is not exercising a path nobody else runs.

`-D WGR_BUILD_XML=<file>` still exists for a build that needs more than a path — it
names an hxcpp build-tool XML outright, and wins over everything above. `test/check.py`
uses it, because the checks link a *headless* wgrender (`SOKOL_DUMMY_BACKEND`), which
is a different build rather than a different directory.

### A web guest, from your own hxml

A JS guest needs a wasm host beside it: wgrender compiled with Emscripten, exporting the
calls the guest makes. One line in the section that builds your guest does that:

```
-lib wgrender-hx
--main Game
--js out/web/game.js
--macro wgr.macros.WebHost.build()
```

It builds wgrender's web library if it has to, links `wgrender-host.js` and
`wgrender-host.wasm` next to your `--js` output, and writes `boot.js` and an
`index.html` to load them. `boot.js` is regenerated every build, since it has to match
the host; `index.html` is written once and is yours after that. The line can sit
anywhere in the section — Haxe reads the whole section before it runs the macro.

The host exports exactly what your guest calls, which is about a quarter smaller
gzipped than exporting the whole binding. To find out what that is, the macro compiles
your program a second time in a child `haxe`, with your own arguments plus
`-dce full -D no-inline --no-output --json`: with inlining off, dead-code elimination
leaves the `wgr.impl.Raw` wrappers you reach as declarations, and `--json` lists them.
So your own build is untouched — `-dce no --debug` is fine — and nothing is read out of
generated JavaScript. `-D no-inline` can only ever list more than you need, never less,
so the worst case is a slightly bigger wasm. The child takes a fraction of a second,
and the link is skipped when the list, the flags, wgrender's library and the host glue
are all unchanged.

- `-D wgr-host=full` exports the whole binding and skips the child compile. Good for
  development, since the host then only relinks when wgrender changes, and the way to
  rule the listing out if something misbehaves.
- `-D wgr-build-dir=<dir>` is where linked hosts are cached; `build/webhost` by default.
- `-D wgr-title=<text>` and `-D wgr-background=<css colour>` shape the first `index.html`.
- `-D WGRENDER_DIR=<path>` builds against that wgrender instead of the pinned submodule,
  exactly as it does for a native build — so the web host and the desktop binary always
  agree on which wgrender they got.
- `WEB_THREADS`, `BACKEND` and `WEB_DEBUG` in the environment mean what they mean to
  wgrender's own web build.

It needs `make` and Emscripten's `emcc` on the path. A call into wgrender made only
through reflection is invisible to dead-code elimination and will not be listed; mark
its caller `@:keep`. On a native target the line does nothing, so a shared hxml can
carry it.

### The examples

```sh
examples/build.py all      build each one, web and native
examples/build.py drive    run each web build in a headless browser
examples/build.py site     collect them under one page
examples/build.py compare  sizes against wgrender's own C build of each
test/check.py              the binding's 317 assertions
```

Each example is what you would write yourself: `src/`, a `build.web.hxml` and a
`build.desktop.hxml`. Those files *are* the build — `haxe build.web.hxml` in an
example's directory gives you its `out/web`, host and page included — so copying an
example is how to start a project. There is nothing else in an example to copy or to
ignore: `examples/build.py` does the suite's chores for each one by name — it checks the
binding is the one you are working on and current, points the build at this
checkout's wgrender with `-D WGRENDER_DIR`, puts wgrender's sample assets beside a
desktop binary, and serves every example from one server, each in its own
subdirectory. Name examples to limit any command: `examples/build.py serve model`.

Thirty-two of wgrender's 33 C examples are ported — all but `clay`, whose API is C
macros over a C layout library that a JS guest cannot reach — each named after the C
file it ports and keeping its numbers, keys and on-screen text. `examples/build.py list` prints them
with a line each. One more, [`stress`](examples/stress), ports wgrender's benchmark scene
(`tools/bench/stress.c`) rather than an example: thousands of entities for
`tools/benchmarks.py` to measure. The ones to read first:

- [`hello`](examples/hello) and [`hello3d`](examples/hello3d) — the smallest; hello3d
  loads nothing at all, which makes it the size floor
- [`simple`](examples/simple) — a model, a sprite, text, audio and picking, and the one
  the size and frame-cost tables are measured on
- [`2d`](examples/2d) — a 2D world with no Camera2D, which is the point: sprite3d in
  the XY plane under an orthographic camera keeps the 3D scene, layers and picking
- [`fetch`](examples/fetch) — the one place the two targets genuinely differ rather
  than differing at the edges, since `Asset.setFetcher` is hxcpp-only and the web has
  the browser
- [`materials`](examples/materials) — every material kind at once, all of them
  assigned before the mesh they belong to has loaded
- [`environment`](examples/environment) — image-based lighting with no lights in the
  scene at all, plus background blur and tone mapping
- [`instancing`](examples/instancing) — 400 cubes that go up as one draw, and nothing
  in the source asks for it
- [`shaders`](examples/shaders) — four custom shaders, including a toon one on a
  *skinned* model and water that moves its own vertices

[`simple-hxcpp`](examples/simple-hxcpp) is `simple` built the other way, for the size
comparison against the C, Nim and Beef ports.

## Status

`wgr.impl.Raw` covers all 480 of wgrender's calls on hxcpp and 470 on js; the
hand-written API layer above it wraps 478. All 33 of wgrender's C examples could be
written against it without a gap.

The two it leaves alone are a decision, not a backlog: `wgr_text_draw_n` and
`wgr_text_measure_n` take a length in *bytes*, and a Haxe string measures in UTF-16
units, so the two disagree for anything non-ASCII — passing a substring to `draw()` is
correct and these would not be. `tools/coverage.py --check` fails if either is ever
wrapped after all, so a decision and a to-do stay distinguishable. It holds the js
omissions the same way: six calls that take a C function pointer, which the guest ABI
replaces there.

`tools/refusals.py --check` guards the other direction. wgrender's headers name every value a
setter refuses, and this fails the build when one of those sentences is not repeated
in the binding's docs — the link that broke once already, when a header's "capped at
65536" was copied into a doc comment and the API shape followed the doc rather than
the code.

### Against the C

Same wgrender, same backend, same threading, so the only difference is the language:

| example | C | Haxe | vs C | gzipped | guest js |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| hello3d | 301,866 | 312,357 | 1.03x | **1.02x** | 8,954 |
| particles | 473,289 | 494,452 | 1.04x | **1.01x** | 21,996 |
| simple | 757,457 | 779,052 | 1.03x | **1.01x** | 21,686 |

The wasm is the same wgrender either way; the difference is the guest JS. Frame cost,
JS heap and GC, and what a call across the boundary costs are in
[docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md), which `tools/benchmarks.py` measures with
wgrender's harness against wgrender's C baseline. On `simple`, 16 calls a frame cross
into the wasm; what they cost is lost in the noise of the frame.

For contrast, the same scene compiled all-in-one through hxcpp is 1.69 MB of wasm,
2.3x the C. Keeping the Haxe runtime out of the binary is what the guest shape buys.

Those are `WEB_THREADS=0` on both sides, which is what the examples build: a threaded
build only starts on a cross-origin isolated page, and that needs COOP/COEP headers
that `tools/serve.py` sends and a plain static host does not. `WEB_THREADS=1` builds
the other one, and it works -- `simple` reports its four asset loading workers on the
web, where the single-threaded build loads on the main thread and blocks the frame it
happens on. It costs a flat ~21 KB (~9 KB gzipped) whatever the example, since it is
the pthread runtime rather than anything proportional, and the ratios against C are
unchanged at 1.01-1.02x gzipped: threads are wgrender's cost, paid the same either
way.

| threaded | C | Haxe | vs C gzipped |
|---|---|---|---|
| hello3d | 322,581 | 333,256 | 1.02x |
| particles | 494,432 | 515,776 | 1.01x |
| simple | 779,212 | 800,981 | 1.01x |

## Regenerating the C surface

`tools/gen_raw.py` reads wgrender's `include/*.h` and writes **both** `impl/Raw.cpp.hx`
and `impl/Raw.js.hx` whole — neither is ever patched, so the answer to an API change is
to run it and read what it says:

```
$ tools/gen_raw.py
wgrender-c: 480 functions, 18 enums, 12 structs
  Raw.cpp.hx  478 externs
  Raw.js.hx   467 wrappers
```

**hxcpp reaches every one of wgrender's public functions.** On js it reaches all but
five, and those five take a C function pointer the guest ABI replaces: the four
lifecycle setters and `wgr_asset_add_task`, whose job `wgr_guest_asset_load` does with
an id instead.

The rest of the callback-taking calls do cross, by the route librl's bindings use:
register *one* dispatcher with wgrender and carry a table key in its `user_data`
(`wgr.impl.Trampoline`). On hxcpp that dispatcher is a
`cpp.Callable.fromStaticFunction`; on js it is a single `addFunction`, installed once
for the whole program however many listeners there are. So `Event` and
`Asset.pingHost` work on both targets.

`wgr_input_get_keyboard_state` used to be an eleventh. Its struct is 2,324 bytes — 512
ints of key state plus the keys and characters a frame produced — and the generator's
only shape for a returned struct was to read every field and build the Haxe class,
which means marshalling 581 ints to answer one question about one key. So it learned a
second shape: a struct listed in `OPAQUE` comes back to js as a pointer into the wasm
heap, with the field offsets emitted beside it, and `keys[Escape]` is one `HEAP32`
index. On hxcpp it still wraps the struct, so the two targets differ by a line per
accessor and the public API is identical.

The tool derives the enum cast types, the struct externs and the struct-return heap
reads from the headers. It needs help for four things, declared in its `SPEC` rather
than edited into its output: which C callback typedefs map to which Haxe function
type, which returned structs map to which public value class (whose constructor must
take the C fields in order), which are too big to copy and come back as a heap
pointer, and which functions to skip. Anything it can't map is
left out and **listed**, so a gap is reported rather than silent. Today the only entry
is the two varargs loggers, which it re-adds at fixed arity from `MANUAL`.

Because the binding now declares wgrender's whole API, an app's build derives the
host's `EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS` from the calls its *compiled guest* makes rather than from
the binding — Emscripten cannot strip what is exported, and exporting everything cost
75 KB. The `hello3d` example exports 25 and its host wasm is 242 KB against `simple`'s
689 KB, because it links no model, glTF, audio or particle code at all. The guest fault policy
defaults to log-and-continue.
